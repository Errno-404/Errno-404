## About me

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adam
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in OOP using Java or c++ as well as in low level programming using C or Assembly language!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning system programming using C, OOD with some help of Java and c++.
- âœ¨ In the near future I plan to learn more about Databases and how to connect them to my applications in different
  languages. Moreover, I'd like to learn Kotlin but all in good time!
- :speech_balloon: This page, as well as all my projects, will be documented much better in the near future. As soon as I complete all the work at the university... :thinking:

## My projects

This is just a begging... I have a lot of ideas and interests, but what I currently don't have is time... However,
programming is my passion, so I'll always find some time to write a couple lines of code ;)
